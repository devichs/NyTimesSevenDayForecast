# NyTimesSevenDayForecast
From www.nytimes, edit location and dig into json data to get a seven day forecast for that location

Using firefox, devoloper options, network. View any possible json or application/api type url. Find the interesting url. In this case it was: https://www.nytimes.com/svc/weather/v2/current-and-seven-day-forecast/LPPT.json

(edit location at top of www.nytimes)

Plug that url into the .py file. 

Using requests and/or pickle, process the url to get the expected results. 

My apologies if this process violates any copywright or ownership rights.  I will take this down if so.  This was just an excersise in using python requests to produce some results while trying to manage a json document.
